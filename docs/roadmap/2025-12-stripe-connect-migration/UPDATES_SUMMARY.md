# Stripe Connect Migration - Updates Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-03  
**Status:** Requirements refined with client feedback

---

## Key Updates Based on Client Feedback

### 1. Registration Flow Clarifications

**Existing Implementation:**
- ✅ Step 1: Association leader info (nom, prenom, birthDate, tel, email)
- ✅ Step 2: Association info (clubName, acronyme, adresse, legalStatus, sportType, conditions)
- ✅ User account + Klubr profile creation
- ✅ Email with activation link
- ✅ Auto-link user to klubr profile

**To Implement:**
- ⚠️ Auto-authentication in Angular after email link click
- ⚠️ Complete "Redirect to Complete Your Profile" page

**New Feature:**
- 🆕 Dashboard homepage completion status widget
  - 3 sections: Klub Info / Docs / Stripe Account
  - Progress bars and visual indicators (✅/⚠️/❌)
  - Quick action buttons for each section

---

### 2. Angular Dashboard Enhancements

**Trade Policy Configuration:**
- 🔒 Access: Superadmin ONLY (not association leaders)
- 📊 Display on dashboard homepage for association leaders (read-only)
- Location: Klub completion status widget

**Superadmin Monitoring:**
- 🆕 New dedicated screen: `/admin/connected-accounts`
- ✏️ Enhanced existing screen: `/admin/klub/listing`
  - New column: Stripe Account Status
  - New filters: KYC complete/incomplete, charges enabled/disabled
  - Bulk action: Send KYC reminder emails

**Fee Statement Generation:**
- ⚠️ Note: Requires facturation module refactoring
- Priority: Medium (after core features)

**Refund Management:**
- 🆕 Access from `/admin/klub/listing` via "Manage Refunds" button per klub
- 🔒 Access control: Superadmin (all) + Association Leader (own klub only)

---

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

**Backend Validation (Primary):**
- ✅ Check `charges_enabled: true` BEFORE displaying donation form
- This prevents 99% of `account_inactive` and `account_kyc_incomplete` errors

**Svelte Defensive Handling (Secondary):**
- 🛡️ Handle `account_inactive` and `account_kyc_incomplete` as safety net
- Note: Should rarely trigger due to backend validation

**Rationale:**
- Backend validation is authoritative
- Frontend handles edge cases (race conditions, stale data)

---

### 4. Exceptional Refund Workflow - Complete Redesign

**Current State:**
- Manual process via email to support team
- No system tracking
- Mentioned in FAQ as manual-only

**New System:**
- 🆕 Admin interface to manage manual workflow
- 🔄 7-step process with status tracking
- 📧 Automated email notifications at each step
- 📁 Document management (signed declarations)
- 🔐 Role-based access control
- 📊 Audit trail for all actions

**Process Phases:**

1. **Request Initiation**
   - Donor emails support → Association leader creates request in system
   - Status: `awaiting_declaration`

2. **Donor Declaration**
   - System emails donor with declaration PDF template
   - Donor signs and emails back
   - Association leader uploads to system
   - Status: `pending_approval`

3. **Approval**
   - Superadmin OR Association Leader reviews and approves/denies
   - Status: `approved` or `denied`

4. **Stripe Refund**
   - System processes refund via Stripe API
   - Status: `processing` → `completed` or `failed`

5. **Notifications**
   - Emails sent to: Donor, Association Leader, Superadmin
   - Includes cancellation attestation PDF

**Access Control:**
- Superadmin: Full access to ALL refund requests
- Association Leader: Access ONLY to their klub's refunds

**Special Cases:**
- Fraud (> 10k€): TRACFIN notification, block donor
- Legal dispute: Freeze until court decision
- Payment error: Fast-track if no receipt generated
- Retraction (14 days): Simple cancellation

**Database Changes:**
- Modified `receipt_cancellations` table with status workflow
- New event types in `financial_audit_logs`
