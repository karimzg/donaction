# List untested behaviors

## Goal

Identify and catalog all untested behaviors in specific areas of the codebase, we want to increase app stability focusing on user interactions and edge cases.

## Rules

- List every untested behavior
- Group by distinct sections
- Focus on functional aspects only
- Ignore technical details

## Process steps

1. Think about behaviors to test based on existing onces
2. Determine a score, 0: not needed, 5: critical core flow to test
3. Group them by different sections
4. Prioritize based on score and impact
5. Display organized minimal bullet list of untested behaviors
