Thank you. Now:

0) Output text in user's preferred language.

1) Evaluate your own work. List all its strength and flaws.

2) Give it a mark between 0 and 20. Justify your mark with an argumentative paragraph.

3) Give yourself a list of suggestions that will make the mark 20. Number each suggestion.

4) Rewrite your work by following recommendations from point 3). Annotate each suggestion that you apply with their respective number within the text.

5) Ask me if I want to repeat the process again. We well be doing so until your work is marked 20/20.
