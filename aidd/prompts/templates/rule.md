# Rules content:

## Groups

- Not needed for short rules content
- Identify rule groups
- Wait for user validation
- No MD titles, use "Group's name :"
- Use small generic example peer group IF NEEDED

## Bullet point rules

- When mentioned existing specific code, please mention full file path prefixed by "@" (no backticks, no need to write folder mentions)
- Format globs without @, ex:
- Backticks for code ref
- Bullet points only
- Remove non-essential, no fluff
- 1 ultra short (3–7 words) rule per bullet point
