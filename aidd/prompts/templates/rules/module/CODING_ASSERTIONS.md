# Coding Guidelines

> Those rules must be minimal because the MUST be checked after EVERY CODE GENERATION.

## Requirements to complete a feature

**A feature is really completed if ALL of the above are satisfied: if not, iterate to fix all until all are green.**

## Steps to follow

1. Check their is no duplication
2. Ensure code is re-used
3. Run all those commands, in order to ensure code is perfect:

```markdown
| Order | Command               | Description                  |
|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
```

<!-- IMPORTANT: THOSE ARE RULES FOR AI, DO NOT USE THOSE INTO FILLED TEMPLATE.

In order to complete a feature at its best, always check at the end of the implementation:

Example:

- typecheck
- lint
- tests
- format
- build
- unused code detection
- documentation generation
- security analysis
- duplication

-->
