2. Check existing tags and get version !`VERSION=$(git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1)` (if none exists, use "1.0.0")
3. Gather changes: `git log --oneline "$VERSION..HEAD"`
4. Generate comprehensive release notes with rules and template
5. Calculate new version number (if not specified by user):
   1. If "BREAKING CHANGE" in notes, increment major
   2. If "feat" in notes, increment minor
   3. If "fix" in notes, increment patch
6. **Provide full template, ask for user approval**
7. Only add to commit files that have been modified for the version bump
